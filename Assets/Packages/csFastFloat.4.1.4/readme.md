# csFastFloat : a fast and accurate float parser
[![.NET](https://github.com/CarlVerret/csFastFloat/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CarlVerret/csFastFloat/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

C# port of Daniel Lemire's [fast_float](https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float) fully ported from C++ to C#. In older versions (5.0 and under) it is up to 9 times faster than the standard library in some cases while providing exact results.

# Note

An important portion of our work had been merged to .NET Runtime within version 7.0 of the .NET Framework.


# Benchmarks

We use the realistic files  in /data. The mesh.txt data file contains numbers that are easier to parse whereas the canada.txt data file is representative of a more challenging scenario.  Synthetic.txt contains 150 000 random floats. We compare  the `Double.Parse()` function from the runtime library with our `FastFloat.ParseDouble()` function. The `ParseNumberString() only` function parses the string itself without any float computation: it might represent an upper bound on the possible performance.

In this repo [FastFloatTestBench](https://github.com/CarlVerret/FastFloatTestBench) we demonstrate a concrete performance gain obtained with FastFloat.ParseDouble() with the [CSVHelper](https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper) library.  This is one of the fastest CSV parser available.



# Requirements

.NET Standard 2.0 or newer. Under .NET 5 framework or newer, the library takes advantage of the new Math.BigMul() and Sse4.1 (SIMD) functions.

# Compile and testing

As this library targets multiple framework, you can specify the target framework version with -f parameter :

``` command line
dotnet build -c Release -f net8.0
dotnet test -f net8.0

```
If you omit the target framework and you don't have both .net 8.0 and dotnetcore 3.1 SDKs installed you may experience an error when building or running tests.

The set of unit tests in /TestcsFastFloat project combines unit tests from many libraries.  It includes tests used by the Go Team.
Additional info on Nigel Tao's work can be found [here](https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/eisel-lemire.html#testing).  It also include strtod test file that can be found [here](https://github.com/ahrvoje/numerics/blob/master/strtod/strtod_tests.toml).




Some unit tests are based on [Approvals.net library](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net).  They require a diff tool installed on your computer.  Tests will be automatically skiped if no diff tool is found.


# Usage

Two functions are available: `FastDoubleParser.ParseDouble` and `FastFloatParser.ParseFloat`. Since v3.0, TryParse pattern is supported for each function.

`String`, `char *`  and `ReadOnlySpan<char>` are supported inputs.

```C#
using csFastFloat;


double x;
float y;
double z;
double answer = 0;
foreach (string l in lines)
{
        x = FastDoubleParser.ParseDouble(l);
        FastDoubleParser.TryParseDouble(l, out z);
        
        y = FastFloatParser.ParseFloat(l);
}
```

Input strings are expected to be valid UTF-16.

Trailing content in the string is ignored.  You may pass an optional `out int characters_consumed` parameter
`FastDoubleParser.ParseDouble(l, out int characters_consumed)` if you wich to check how many characters were processed. Some users may want to fail when the number of characters consumed does not match the string length.


For UTF-8 or ASCII inputs, you may pass a `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` argument. You can also pass
an optional `out int characters_consumed` parameter to track the number of characters consumed
by the number pattern.
